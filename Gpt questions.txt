1) Can you raise the size of the second line "Nature-inspired..." just a little bit.

3) On the PC, cut the green from the top to the "Welcome to Martin ..." to the "Welcome to Martin ..." maybe by half. The bottom of the portfolio picture to the bottom of the green screen should be the same width as the top of the screen to "Welcome to Martin ...". It is perfect on the smartphone, so don't change.
4) The same concept with the lighter green for Gallery. The bottom of the subheadings (like "ALL"/"Animlas") to the first line should be the same with from the very top of the lighter green screen to Gallery.The smartphone is perfect so don't change this.
